 Class that implements a view that can be pulled out by a handle, 
 similar to the Notification Center in iOS 5. This class supports
 pulling in the horizontal or vertical axis. This is determined by
 the values for openedCenter and closedCenter that you set: if
 both have the same x coordinate, the pulling should happen in the
 vertical axis, or the horizontal axis otherwise.
